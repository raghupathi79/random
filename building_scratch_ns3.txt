Perfect — this is a **very common mistake** when running ns-3 programs.
Let’s fix it properly 👇

---

### ⚙️ Problem:

You ran:

```bash
./ns3 run "scratch/gobackn-arq.cc"
```

But `./ns3` expects the **program name (without `.cc`)**, **not the file name**.

---

### ✅ Correct command:

If your file is located at:

```
scratch/gobackn-arq.cc
```

then the correct command is:

```bash
./ns3 run "scratch/gobackn-arq"
```

---

### 🧩 If you just created it, follow the complete workflow:

1. Move into your ns-3 directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ns-allinone-3.41/ns-3.41
   ```
2. Verify your file exists:

   ```bash
   ls scratch | grep gobackn
   ```

   or if it’s in a subfolder:

   ```bash
   ls scratch/gobackn-arq.cc
   ```
3. Build ns-3 to compile your scratch program:

   ```bash
   ./ns3 build
   ```
4. Run it:

   ```bash
   ./ns3 run "scratch/gobackn-arq"
   ```

---

### ⚠️ Extra tip:

If you want to see the **NetAnim output**, make sure your code includes:

```cpp
AnimationInterface anim("gobackn-arq.xml");
```

Then after the run, open it with:

```bash
netanim gobackn-arq.xml
```

---

Would you like me to give you a **ready-to-run Go-Back-N ARQ ns-3 example** (fully working with animation)?
You can just paste it into `scratch/gobackn-arq.cc` and run immediately.
